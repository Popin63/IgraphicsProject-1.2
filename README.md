# IgraphicsProject-1.2
# 1st Year 2nd Semester Academic Group Project

A game I made during my first year of my B.Sc. program's second semester.
The iGraphics header file was used to create this game, which was created in C++. 
Visual Studio 2013 was used for programming, while Photoshop CS6 was used for graphics.

This is a game that may be played with others. 
At any one moment, no more than two players may participate at the same time. 
During games, just press enter to switch to the second player. 
Player 1 has the option of using the keyboard, while Player 2 has the option of using the mouse.
